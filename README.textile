SevenMacros is a patch for Tekkub's Buffet mod that enables seven separate macros:
AutoBandage - Just for bandages
AutoFood - Just for food
AutoWater - Just for water
AutoHP - Just for Health Pots
AutoMP - Just for Mana Pots
AutoHStone - Just for Health Stones
AutoGem - Just for Mana Gems

I made this patch because I like to exercise precise control over when I use what, e.g. often spamming drink while in combat so that I start drinking as soon as I'm out of combat. Buffet's default set up made it so I'd use a mana pot instead of trying to drink, thus I made this patch.

To use, copy the Buffet.lua file in this archive over your existing Buffet.lua file.

Then create macros (in non-character specific, since 3.0.2 added many slots there) for whatever functionality you want; e.g. make an empty macro called AutoBandage and drag it onto your bar where you want your bandage hot key.
